# Tachiyomi iOS
##### An iOS port of the popular [Tachiyomi Manga Reader for Android](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi).

## About the Project

Hello fellow manga enthusiasts! For too long now Android has had the crown when it comes to the best manga reader app with Tachoyomi absolutely destroying any alternatives out there. Having recently moved to iOS for work reasons, I found myself missing the Tachiyomi experience as nothing on iOS comes close. Being that I am capable of porting Tachiyomi to iOS (I am a mobile software developer), I thought I best have a crack at it.

I should stress that this is a side project of mine and as such I make no guarentees on how quickly it will move - I will be working on it entirely in my free time (of which I don't have much!). There are a number of technical challenges with iOS, especially around how \**ahem*\* 'legitimate content' is accessed, as Apple are notiously strict on this.

I am working from the Android codebase as a reference, however the port will be implemented with modern best practices in mind and will not be a like for like implementation. Additionally, not all features of the Android version will be present initially; I will be focussing on my own use case of browsing a source, adding to the library and reading - other features *may* follow after.

Please feel free to star this repo to stay in the loop about updates!
